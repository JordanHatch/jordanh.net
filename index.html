<p>I help organisations use modern technology and digital practices to transform how they work.</p>

<p>I'm a founding member of the teams that started the digital transformation of government in <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk">the United Kingdom</a> and <a href="https://www.dta.gov.au/">Australia</a>.</p>

<p>Most recently, I've worked at the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/dit">Department of International Trade</a>, leading the development of the technology approach supporting the UK's trade policy after it leaves the European Union.</p>

<p>I've previously served as a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/young-advisors">young advisor</a> to Neelie Kroes at the European Commission, and co-founded <a href="http://codeweek.eu/">Code Week</a>. I have also worked with <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/">Rewired State</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="{{ site.url }}/posts" title="my blog posts">occasionally write</a> about things I've been up to. I tweet at <a href="https://twitter.com/1jh">@1jh</a>, share what I'm reading on <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:1jh">Pinboard</a>, and <a href="https://flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/">enjoy photography</a> in my spare time.</p>
