<p>Most recently, I helped the Australian Government to start <a href="https://www.dto.gov.au/">its digital transformation journey</a>.</p>

<p>Before that, I worked at the UK's <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/" title="Government Digital Service blog">Government Digital Service</a> and helped build <a href="https://www.gov.uk">GOV.UK</a>.</p>

<p>I was a <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/young-advisors">young advisor</a> to Neelie Kroes at the European Commission, and co-founded <a href="http://codeweek.eu/">Code Week</a>. I have also worked with <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/">Rewired State</a>.</p>

<p>I <a href="{{ site.url }}/posts">occasionally write</a> about things I've been up to. I tweet at <a href="https://twitter.com/1jh">@1jh</a> and post what I'm reading to <a href="https://pinboard.in/u:1jh">Pinboard</a>.</p>
