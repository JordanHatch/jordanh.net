Since September, I've been working on the "user audit" of [myGov][mygov]. We're a small team supporting an expert panel, led by [David Thodey][david-thodey]. It's a short sharp review: we started in September and we'll be done and dusted by Christmas.

The audit is not just looking at the current myGov platform - the thing you use to sign into some federal government services. We're going wider: thinking about the delivery of digital government services, including across jurisdictions. So lots to get stuck into.

You [can make a submission to the audit][submissions] until 10 November. If you use government services, work on government services, or help people use government services, please do.

Here's the [full terms of reference][tors] if you fancy a read.
