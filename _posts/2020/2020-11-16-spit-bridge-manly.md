2020 has, of course, been a relentless year. A few weeks ago, I took a week's holiday from work and spent some time around Sydney.

It had been years since I last walked from the Spit Bridge to Manly, so I packed the camera and hopped on the bus down to the Spit.

Finally, a trip back to the city on the Manly Ferry.
