From [Lyon](/posts/lyon) and [the Alps](/posts/french-alps), the final stop on my trip was Geneva.

I took an early morning train from Bourg Saint-Maurice, winding through the valleys of French mountains and across the spans of great bridges.

I arrived in Geneva to find it a rather compact city, one that was really easy to get around. On checking into my hotel, I was given a free visitor travelcard for the duration of my stay. (Just imagine that happening in London!)

The landscape around Geneva is stunning, making for great photos. I had a stroll around the lake and up towards the _[Jet D'Eau](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_d%27Eau)_, an unlikely landmark for a city with so much history.

Geneva's history dates back more than 2000 years, back to early Roman occupation.

Similar to Lyon and many other European cities, Geneva has a beautiful old town, with a maze of streets and laneways, churches and civic buildings.

Geneva is also home to many international and non-government organisations. My hotel was across the road from the [Palais des Nations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palace_of_Nations), one of the main offices of the United Nations.

My stop in Geneva was very short, which meant I didn't make it to CERN - but [their guided tour looks great](https://visit.cern/tours/guided-tours-individuals) and it's on my list for a future visit.

As my flight departed out of Geneva, climbing between the snow-topped mountains, I was again reminded of just how little I have seen of the places on my doorstep. I returned home with a renewed determination to get out and see more of England and Europe.

If you'd like to see some more photos, there's a couple more [in my Flickr set](https://www.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/albums/72157678449976893/).
