<p>I&rsquo;ve not written week notes for two weeks. I burned out a bit at work, so I took a week off to do other things.</p>

<p>I went to Edinburgh for the Fringe festival, for the first time. My favourites were <a href="http://www.jethrocomptonltd.co.uk/#!the-capone-trilogy/ctkz">The Capone Trilogy</a>, <a href="http://www.anothersoup.co.uk/#!dorian-gray/c1dli">The Picture of Dorian Gray</a>, and <a href="http://www.magnificentbastard.co.uk/shitfacedshake.html">Sh*t-Faced Shakespeare</a>.</p>

<p>Over the Bank Holiday weekend, I visited the Black Country and Gloucestershire, spending time with friends.</p>

<p>Also, I did write a little bit about <a href="http://probablyisjordan.tumblr.com/post/94921136506/my-first-week-at-gds">my first week at GDS</a>.</p>

<p>Normal service resumes this week. :)</p>
