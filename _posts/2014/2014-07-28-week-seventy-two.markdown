<p>I&rsquo;ve spent most of my week building functionality into <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/panopticon">Panopticon</a> to add a workflow for publishing tags.</p>

<p>On Tuesday afternoon, we had our monthly all-staff meeting. Afterwards, quite a few of us went over to the South Bank for drinks in the sun.</p>

<p>Later on this week, we spent some time designing how tags will be represented in the upcoming <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/content-store">content store</a>. This will help unblock future search and browse work.</p>

<p>I helped with planning how we&rsquo;re going to build the new design for the specialist sector browse pages (such as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/schools-colleges/curriculum-qualifications">this one</a>). In the new design, the order and grouping of the links will be heavily curated to make it easier for users to find the content they need. We&rsquo;ll be building new tools to make that possible.</p>

<p>Also this week, <a href="https://twitter.com/KushalP">Kush</a> gave a great tech talk on 
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Advanced_Message_Queuing_Protocol">AMQP</a> and <a href="http://www.rabbitmq.com">RabbitMQ</a>.</p>

<p>And finally, it was great to see GOV.UK get <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2bub8e/has_anyone_noticed_that_govuk_is_really_good/">a bit of praise on Reddit</a> over the weekend.</p>
