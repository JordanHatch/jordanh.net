<p>This week has been quite busy. I&rsquo;m writing this from a coffee shop at Heathrow&rsquo;s Terminal 5, so apologies for this being a bit brief.</p>

<p>I feel as though this week has been tying up a few loose ends before I go away on holiday. Aside from that, there were a few highlights:</p>

<p>On Tuesday this week, I went along to the Efficiency and Reform Group&rsquo;s &lsquo;all hands&rsquo; event, where Mike and Russell talked about GDS. We had our regular sprint retrospective and planning in the afternoon.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, I wrote a migration to automatically tag travel advice and business support schemes with organisations. This exposed some unnecessary coupling between our content models from years gone by, so I spent some time fixing that as well.</p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon, the Technology Clan had a field trip out to the Ministry of Justice. We watched their show-and-tell, and then had a joint session with their dev team where we each gave talks about some of the things we&rsquo;ve been working on.</p>

<p>I paired with David S on Friday morning, as we added a new filter into Panopticon. It was good to be able to share around a bit more knowledge of how Panopticon works.</p>

<p>There won&rsquo;t be any week notes for a couple of weeks whilst I&rsquo;m away. Thanks to everyone who sent suggestions for my trip.</p>
