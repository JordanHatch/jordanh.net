<p>I spent a lot of this week interviewing candidates for the junior developer roles we advertised a while back. It&rsquo;s the first time I&rsquo;ve been on an interview panel, and I&rsquo;m finding it really interesting.</p>

<p>In addition, I&rsquo;ve had chance to pick up a couple of Search and Browse stories this week. I cleaned up the remnants of an old specialist sector in the search index, which will unblock the &lsquo;Services and information&rsquo; page for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/marine-management-organisation">Marine Management Organisation</a> going live. I also made a change to <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/panopticon">Panopticon</a> so that it won&rsquo;t delete routes for content owned by the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall">Whitehall app</a>. This fixes a problem where an &ldquo;unpublished&rdquo; detailed guide showed a generic &ldquo;gone&rdquo; page instead of a custom note or redirect (eg. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/managing-radioactive-substances">this &ldquo;unpublished&rdquo; guide</a>).</p>

<p>We had another chat about the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/content-store">Content Store</a> this week, and how it should handle tags. We&rsquo;ve still got some unanswered questions around how curated lists of content might work and how we can link between content in a way that&rsquo;s resilient to changes in URLs. However, it&rsquo;s good to get more of this nailed down.</p>

<p>On Friday, <a href="https://twitter.com/neillyneil">Neil</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bandyroos">Ben</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/gkfrancis">Graham</a> and I sat down to talk about the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies">policies format</a> and how it could look in the future. We know from analytics that it isn&rsquo;t working very well right now, and many of the existing policies will change in the next parliament (regardless of the outcome of the 2015 election). It also seems like there&rsquo;s some good opportunities to join up the work we&rsquo;ve been doing building specialist sectors (which we&rsquo;re renaming to &ldquo;topics&rdquo;). Watch this space!</p>

<p>And this week saw the return of floor meetings to the GOV.UK Team. Floor meetings were a thing we used to do as an entire organisation until we grew too big for one floor. It&rsquo;s nice and informal and I think it&rsquo;s really good to bring people together under the guise of being part of the same team, which is something we&rsquo;ve lacked a bit lately.</p>
