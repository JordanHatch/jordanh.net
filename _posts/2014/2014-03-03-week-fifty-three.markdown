<p>The start of this week was the end of our team&rsquo;s first sprint. I&rsquo;d finished up the work I&rsquo;d been doing last week, so I spent a bit of time hacking on the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/release">Release app</a> to add a view of all recent deployments, which I thought might be useful.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, we had our first retrospective, and moved onto our planning session for this sprint. It took a little while to get there, but I think we now have a decent mix of stories for both search and specialist browse.</p>

<p>I helped out with a bunch of urgent work around the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/ukvi">UK Visas &amp; Immigration</a> transition on Wednesday. The sections on <a href="https://www.gov.uk/visas-immigration">the Visas and immigration browse page</a> needed some changes, along with some extra items in the &ldquo;popular links&rdquo; group.</p>

<p>I also helped release the specialist browse page for <a href="https://www.gov.uk/immigration-operational-guidance">Immigration operational guidance</a> on Friday. This seemed to have fallen through the cracks and I don&rsquo;t think anyone owned it, but it was the missing route through to important content for UKVI&rsquo;s specialist users. It turned out there were a few issues preventing content from being tagged properly. I fixed those and deployed <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/frontend/pull/533">a change to Frontend</a> to set up the new browse page.</p>

<p>On Friday, I went down to Whitehall for a lunchtime event as part of the Cabinet Office&rsquo;s &ldquo;Digital Fortnight&rdquo;. There were short talks from a handful of people around the Cabinet Office. I liked Rod Sweek&rsquo;s talk about how the team behind the <a href="https://twitter.com/number10gov">@Number10gov Twitter account</a> use analytics. I also liked Amy Khan&rsquo;s talk about the GOV.UK style guide and some tips when publishing departmental content to GOV.UK. In the latter, I ended up talking a little bit about how we&rsquo;re improving search.</p>

<p>I went to see <a href="http://templestudioslondon.com/">The Drowned Man</a> again on Thursday. It was as good as my first visit last week. Still working on a post about it.</p>
