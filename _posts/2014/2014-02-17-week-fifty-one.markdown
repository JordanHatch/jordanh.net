<p>I started this week by spending two days on the 2nd Line Support team, monitoring the infrastructure alerts for GOV.UK. I used some of my time on the team to extend <a href="https://github.com/JordanHatch/situation-room-dashboard">the Situation Room Dashboard</a> to add <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/12435302775/">a view for a single room</a> that fits nicely on a tablet. I&rsquo;d like to roll this out across the office so that it&rsquo;s easier to see what&rsquo;s happening in a room. It would be a pretty decent low-cost alternative to those big enterprise systems you see in large offices. I&rsquo;ve emailed our office manager to see if I can get the ball rolling on this.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, we started our first sprint of the new GOV.UK Specialist project. We&rsquo;ve had a talk about the words we&rsquo;re using and we&rsquo;ve decided to rename &ldquo;industry sectors&rdquo; to &ldquo;specialist sectors&rdquo;. This meant there were a fair few references to change across all our different apps, so I picked up the work to do that. Later on in the week, I was pairing with <a href="https://twitter.com/tommypalm">Tommy</a> on a story to make every format in Whitehall register with Panopticon. We ran into a few issues around deciding how to store the format type of the content, as Whitehall&rsquo;s model of types and subtypes is a bit different to the Publishing Platform&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>I feel like I&rsquo;ve really struggled to build up any enthusiasm for my work this week. It&rsquo;s a shame. I hope it gets better next week.</p>
