<p>Our team spent most of this week re-prioritising, working out what the most important things are from our roadmap. I think it was a worthwhile effort and has helped us to get a good perspective of what we should be doing next.</p>

<p>I used that as a chance to clean up our team wiki a bit too - the IA was a bit confusing and we still had a lot of pages around for &ldquo;features&rdquo; planned very early this year but which have since been consolidated, scrapped, or picked up by other teams.</p>

<p>I made a couple of prototypes of what policies could look like in the future, after the discussion we had last week. I&rsquo;m experimenting with the idea of splitting apart the intent of the government from the actual projects and programmes that the government has committed to doing.</p>

<p>And on Thursday, I went to Brussels to meet with <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/commission_2010-2014/kroes/">Neelie Kroes</a>. We talked about the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/young-advisors">Young Advisors Group</a> and <a href="http://codeweek.eu">Code Week</a>, and I gave some feedback on the group which I hope will help to shape it in the next Commission.</p>
