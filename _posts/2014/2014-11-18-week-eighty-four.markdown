<p>The second week in my flat has felt a bit more homely than the first. I&rsquo;ve now moved in a lot of my things and my parents came and helped fix a bunch of things that needed doing.</p>

<p>On Search and Browse this week, I finished the work to add pagination to our new &ldquo;latest changes&rdquo; list for a sub-topic. (It&rsquo;s felt like the work was a lot more complex than it should have been.) As we&rsquo;re quite close to our deadline for releasing this work, along with the email alerts feature, I <a href="https://twitter.com/1jh/status/533299505140334592">put up a &lsquo;skirmish wall&rsquo;</a> on Friday to help focus the team on the things we need to do.</p>

<p>We ran the second session of GDS&rsquo; code club on Thursday. We had a good turnout again, and at the end of the session everyone was building their own GOV.UK organisation page. I&rsquo;m really pleased with the format and I&rsquo;m hoping it continues through the remaining four weeks.</p>

<p>And along with a cohort of GDS folks, I went to the Houses of Parliament on Wednesday for a guided tour. It&rsquo;s not my first time looking around Parliament, but I always find it fascinating to be able to walk through the House of Commons and the House of Lords and see all the tradition that still remains.</p>
