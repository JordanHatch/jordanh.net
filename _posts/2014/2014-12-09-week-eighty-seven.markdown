<p>We released email alerts and the latest changes feed for sub-topics on Tuesday. For example, take a look at <a href="https://www.gov.uk/business-tax/paye/latest">the most recent changes to content about PAYE</a>. It was great to be able to hit our deadline on time, and for everything to be released without a hitch (we like <a href="https://www.gov.uk/service-manual/agile/continuous-delivery.html">making releases boring</a>).</p>

<p>We also finished another transition blocker this week: merging the <em>Schools and Colleges</em> topic into the <em>Children&rsquo;s Services</em> topic, creating a new topic: <a href="https://www.gov.uk/schools-colleges-childrens-services">Schools, colleges and children&rsquo;s services</a>. This unblocked the transition of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/ofqual">Ofqual</a> to GOV.UK, and will also allow us to turn the <em>Services and information</em> page on soon for the Department for Education.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve spent the rest of the week picking up fixes, writing documentation, and generally tidying things up. We&rsquo;ve also been planning how we could build end-to-end monitoring for email alerts, to give us greater visibility on whether the entire email alert stack is working.</p>

<p>Finally, I wrote a blog post this week about the code club we&rsquo;ve been running at GDS, and (more importantly) why it&rsquo;s important to have a basic understanding of code at all. It&rsquo;s <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2014/12/08/code-club-at-gds/">live on the GDS blog</a>, have a read.</p>
