<p>I started this week picking up a couple of smaller stories in our backlog. I updated the specialist navigation pages to use the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/slimmer/pull/65">new beta notice inserter provided by Slimmer</a>, and I also worked on creating a new mainstream browse subsection to help the HMRC transition, called &ldquo;Dealing with HMRC&rdquo;. Later this week, I&rsquo;ve  worked to include organisations in the search index for non-Whitehall content, so that we can start to build scoped search across the whole of GOV.UK. It&rsquo;s meant bringing some of our old indexing code up-to-date with our search libraries.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I had quite a few meetings and chats with various people around GDS. We had a retrospective on the UKVI transition that happened a couple of weeks ago, to talk about what went well and what we&rsquo;d like to do better next time around. We had a separate discussion about an infrastructure problem last Friday, where some documents on GOV.UK weren&rsquo;t available for a short period of time.</p>

<p>I went to see The Drowned Man for a fourth time on Tuesday night, with Matt, David and Ben. It is still excellent. I spent a lot of time outside the studios this time around.</p>

<p>On Wednesday and Thursday this week, I travelled to Brussels for a meeting of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/young-advisors">Young Advisors Group</a> at the European Commission. We talked about <a href="http://codeweek.eu">Code Week</a> and where we&rsquo;re at with plans for this year, and it was good to work on things together in the same room. A group of Digital Champions from all over Europe told us about what they&rsquo;ve been doing, and where we could offer more help and clarity. We also had a few hours with <a href="https://twitter.com/neeliekroeseu">Neelie Kroes</a>, where we discussed things like coding in the classroom and net neutrality.</p>
