<p>Short notes this week.</p>

<p>I started this week on the 2nd Line Support team. We had some excitement on Tuesday with the reshuffle, as Number 10 were keeping GOV.UK updated in real-time as the new ministerial line-up was announced.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, I went to Civil Service Live. I helped out on the GDS stand, talking to people about what we do. I was a bit underwhelmed by the whole event though: it felt like the balance between suppliers and civil servants tipped too far towards the former.</p>

<p>Later this week, back on the Search and Browse team, I started a story to add workflow to Panopticon for publishing tags from &lsquo;draft&rsquo; to 'live&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s quite a big piece of work, and it&rsquo;s not helped by the amount of tech debt in the app.</p>

<p>I went to the House of Commons on Tuesday evening. I never realised that you can visit the Stranger&rsquo;s Gallery without a ticket. It&rsquo;s really interesting to see Parliament in session.</p>
