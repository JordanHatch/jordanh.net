<p>Recently, <a href="http://alicebartlett.co.uk/six-months-at-gds">Alice wrote about her first six months at the Government Digital Service</a>. Reading it made me think back to my own first week.</p>

<p>GDS was my first real job: I&rsquo;d never worked in an office before. There was about thirty or forty of us in early November 2011.</p>

<p>Until early this year, I kept a journal. I read back through to the things my 17-year-old self wrote at the time. I thought I&rsquo;d publish them here.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s my first day:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>I caught a very early train down to London this morning, and then headed straight to Holborn to Aviation House, where I got an ID card and met with James Stewart. He took me up to the office and I met everyone, and everyone was really friendly!</p>
  
  <p>Mark O'Neil recognised me and gave me a pack of chocolate biscuits :-) and me, richard and james had a chat about the app architecture and things.
  For lunch a few people asked me to come with them to a vegetarian restaurant in covent garden which was really nice! Had like a jalfrezi meal :-) had a lovely chat with jamie arnold too!</p>
  
  <p>This afternoon I got loads of work done on the calendars, ran into a few bugs though, and left about half 5.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As the week went on, I carried on working on the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/calendars">Calendars app</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Today i expanded the calendars to support other calendar scopes eg daylight saving. Richard was pleased :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>By Thursday, I started talking with <a href="https://twitter.com/garethr">Gareth</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/dafyddbach">Dai</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>At work, finished calendars, spoke a lot to Gareth and Dafyydd and they were really nice and helpful! Also got to use the Done stamp :-)</p>
</blockquote>

<p>And then Friday finished with a pub lunch:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>For lunch, we went to a pub nearby and had ham, egg and chips, with Richard, James, Dave, Dafydd, Paul and a couple more :-)</p>
  
  <p>This afternoon we did a show-and-tell for the end of the sprint, and I showed off my calendars app. It went down really well and I felt really proud :-)</p>
  
  <p>We did a retrospective afterwards, and Josh and Dave put post-it notes up on the wall saying that me joining the team was something that went well this sprint :-) Josh said he likes me! :-)</p>
  
  <p>I headed back to Euston and had a lovely train journey back up north! And got a tweet from the product lead, Tom Loosemore, saying he heard I &lsquo;delivered&rsquo; on the project and 'nice job&rsquo;.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been at GDS for more than two-and-a-half years now. In that time, we&rsquo;ve changed a lot. But I&rsquo;m glad that we still do a lot of the things that we did on my first week, like team lunches, show-and-tell and using the 'Done&rsquo; stamp.</p>
