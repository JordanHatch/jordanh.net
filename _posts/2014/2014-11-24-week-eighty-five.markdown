<p>It&rsquo;s been a busy week.</p>

<p>We had our sprint planning for our final sprint before our deadline for the HM Revenue and Customs transition to GOV.UK. Whilst HMRC won&rsquo;t be fully transitioning for a little while, we&rsquo;re aiming to finish up email alerts and the latest feed by December 2nd so that we have enough time for a gradual release.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve picked up a few stories this week: I&rsquo;ve added links through to the email subscribe page, and the latest feed, from the sub-topic pages. I worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/futurefabric">Guy</a> to tidy up the design and copy on the subscribe page, to be clearer to users about what they should expect to receive if they sign up for emails. I&rsquo;ve also updated Rails in a lot of our apps, as I noticed a few had fallen behind a bit.</p>

<p>We had the third code club on Thursday: we looked at the <code>&lt;div&gt;</code>, <code>&lt;span&gt;</code> and <code>&lt;table&gt;</code> elements, and then everybody made their own GOV.UK calendar page. A few people have also started making their own websites outside of the weekly sessions, so we had a show-and-tell at the end.</p>

<p>And I went to the Good Law Hackathon on Saturday, at the Ministry of Justice. It was a really interesting hack day - I ended up making something to analyse <a href="http://goodlaw-power-analysis.herokuapp.com/">the occurrences of duties and powers across the statute book</a>. If you missed it, there&rsquo;s a good <a href="https://storify.com/richards1000/the-good-law-hackathon-22-november-2014-london">recap of the event on Storify</a>.</p>
