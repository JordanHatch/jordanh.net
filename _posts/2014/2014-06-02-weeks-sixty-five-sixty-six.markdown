<p>I&rsquo;m combining the last two weeks. We had a bank holiday and a privilege day (a Civil Service thing) so I haven&rsquo;t been around all that much.</p>

<p>Last week, I hosted our all-staff monthly meeting, down at the big lecture theatre over at KCL&rsquo;s Waterloo campus. It was the second time I&rsquo;ve hosted it - I was called in last-minute - but it was just as enjoyable as the last time. The potential irony in hosting an event in a lecture theatre, having not having gone to university, hasn&rsquo;t passed me by.</p>

<p>Also last week, I spent a bit of time with Kirsty from OCTO, looking at the technology branch of the Fast Stream programme. We&rsquo;re interested in what its skill-set would be if it focussed on areas like service design and engineering.</p>

<p>On Search and Browse, we had some more discussions about centralised search indexing. We&rsquo;ve decided to put it on hold whilst the Publishing team build out the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/content-store">Content Store</a>. After talking with Alex and Brad, it was clear that both pieces of work would look really similar once finished. It doesn&rsquo;t make sense for us to start building something huge for it to be superseded in just a few sprints&rsquo; time.</p>

<p>That aside, I&rsquo;ve been picking up some work to tag mainstream content (eg. <a href="https://www.gov.uk/vat-rates">VAT rates</a>) with the departments and agencies that they relate to. We have a few thousand items of mainstream content, so we&rsquo;re trying not to tag them all by hand. As a first-pass, I&rsquo;ve written a script to infer organisations based on the needs in <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/maslow">Maslow</a> that are associated with the content.</p>

<p>This week, we&rsquo;ve been doing some forward planning for our team. We had a sketching session on Wednesday afternoon where we came up with a bunch of new concepts for browse pages. One idea is a browse page for both &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; and 'specialist&rsquo; users together, rather than having separate silos for each. If it&rsquo;s done well, it could make a lot more sense to users. We&rsquo;re going to build a prototype and test it in the lab.</p>

<p>On Thursday afternoon, we spent a few hours planning our team&rsquo;s mid-term roadmap. Now that we&rsquo;ve released the first iteration of unified search, we were struggling to work out what we should do next. It was becoming clear that we needed to step back a bit and talk about the things we think are important. I think there&rsquo;s a bigger picture for search and browse across GOV.UK that we should look at. In particular, we should combine many of the user experiences that <a href="https://www.gov.uk/business-finance-support-finder">all</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/publications">behave</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/cma-cases">in a</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search?q=bank+holidays&amp;filter_organisations%5B%5D=prime-ministers-office-10-downing-street">similar</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/latest?departments%5B%5D=cabinet-office">way</a>.</p>

<p>Outside of work, I&rsquo;ve been doing lots of my own planning, for my trip to the West Coast in a couple of weeks&rsquo; time. If there&rsquo;s anywhere I shouldn&rsquo;t miss whilst I&rsquo;m in San Francisco or Los Angeles, let me know.</p>
