<p>With the bank holiday, it&rsquo;s been a short week.</p>

<p>We had our sprint planning on Tuesday. This sprint is mainly composed of lots of smaller stories, or &ldquo;sand&rdquo;.</p>

<p>One of those stories was to include <a href="https://www.gov.uk/unimoney">the page for the government&rsquo;s new Unimoney campaign</a> in search, as we don&rsquo;t index campaign pages by default. The other story has been to investigate why a deleted specialist sector is still hanging around in the search index.</p>

<p>On Thursday, I was interviewing candidates for the new junior developer roles, with <a href="https://twitter.com/roryoung">Rob</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/bradwright">Brad</a>. We&rsquo;re interviewing a lot more next week.</p>
