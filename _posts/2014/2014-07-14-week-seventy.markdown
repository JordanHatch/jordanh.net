<p>On Monday, I visited Google, where I gave a talk to the people in this year&rsquo;s apprentice programme. I talked a bit about GDS, and the way that we work.</p>

<p>This week, I also spent some time with students visiting GDS from <a href="http://www.parkview.haringey.sch.uk/">Park View School</a>, as part of their tour around central government. <a href="https://twitter.com/CharlotteClancy">Charlotte</a> and I talked about GOV.UK and how we do user research, and then we helped the students out with presentations about their visit.</p>

<p>On Search and Browse, I spent quite a bit of time making sure that the transition of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/mmo">Marine Management Organisation</a> went according to plan. A couple of issues cropped up at the end of last week, so we had to manually archive some content and put some extra redirects in place.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent the latter half of the week on the 2nd Line Support Team, as my turn has come around again. I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m very good at it, but I find it really interesting. So far, it&rsquo;s mainly entailed rebooting lots of machines and reviewing pull requests.</p>

<p>I also wrote up <a href="http://probablyisjordan.tumblr.com/post/91231977281/california">a short post about my trip to California</a>.</p>
