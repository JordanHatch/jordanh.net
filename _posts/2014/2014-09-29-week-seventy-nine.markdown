<p>Short notes this week.</p>

<p>I spent the start of the week prepping for planning, as we&rsquo;ve just finished a slower sprint where we spent most of our time ensuring our upcoming work is in order.</p>

<p>I picked up a small bit of work to stop the tags for content published in the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall">Whitehall publisher</a> from being changed in <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/panopticon">Panopticon</a>. We&rsquo;ve got plans to do the same for content published in <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/publisher">Mainstream publisher</a>, once we build functionality for content to be tagged in the publishing tool itself. Both these changes will make the transition to the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/content-store">Content Store</a> easier.</p>

<p>In the latter half of the week, I attended the Bertelsmann Creativity &amp; Innovation conference, at the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/St._Pancras_Renaissance_London_Hotel">St Pancras Renaissance Hotel</a>. I was part of a panel on Thursday afternoon with <a href="https://twitter.com/zsims">Zach Sims</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lilycole">Lily Cole</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/nickdaloisio">Nick D'Aloisio</a>. <a href="https://twitter.com/marthalanefox">Martha</a> hosted it, and we were joined on stage by <a href="https://twitter.com/iamwill">will.i.am</a> at the end. It was the first panel I&rsquo;ve taken part in and I thought it went quite well.</p>
