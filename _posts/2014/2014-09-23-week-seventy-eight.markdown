<p>We continued our planning work this week. Now that we have a good sense of what we should do next, we took each big &lsquo;feature&rsquo;, dug into the detail of each one, and wrote rough stories. By doing this, we hope to make the team more resilient: if any unexpected blockers arise on a piece of work, we still have other big things we can pick up.</p>

<p>I also carried on tidying up our team wiki. <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Confluence</a> is terrible and breaks in bizarre ways. Despite this, all the pages for old features are now gone, and I&rsquo;ve organised all the things we&rsquo;re working on into themes of work, giving a stronger narrative to our team. Ideally, this should help limit future work too, because if a feature doesn&rsquo;t fit into one of the following, then it&rsquo;s probably not something we should be doing:</p>

<ul><li>Remove detailed guide categories and policy areas</li>
<li>Build a complete search index</li>
<li>Improve the quality of search results</li>
<li>Make search easier to use</li>
<li>Simplify navigation across GOV.UK</li>
</ul><p>I&rsquo;ve had a few conversations this week about the GDS Code Club. It&rsquo;s about time we get things moving - we held out longer than we planned in the hope we could get some more people signing up to help out, but it hasn&rsquo;t really happened. I&rsquo;m fortunate to have been sent the feedback from the pilot of the Cabinet Office Code Club that took place earlier this year, which should help us avoid some easy mistakes.</p>

<p>We continued our work to iterate <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies">policies</a> this week. To a group of people from across GOV.UK, I showed the prototypes I made last week and we talked more about what we know about the current policies format and who&rsquo;s using it (short answer: not much). If you use <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/policies">policies</a> on GOV.UK, we&rsquo;d like to talk with you, so please do <a href="mailto:jordan@jordanh.net">get in touch</a>.</p>
