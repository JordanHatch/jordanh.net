<p>I&rsquo;ll start with the big news: I&rsquo;ve moved to London! It&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/1jh/status/531097749601918976">only taken me three years</a> of <a href="http://probablyisjordan.tumblr.com/post/41454595364/on-long-commutes">commuting</a> to finally get a flat here. I&rsquo;ve spent evenings this week visiting IKEA, buying towels, building furniture, and realising just how much I don&rsquo;t know about <em>living</em>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been picking up a variety of things on Search and Browse this week: I fixed a bug in our new email alerts where links to changed content would link to the GOV.UK homepage, rather than the piece of content itself. I paired with <a href="https://twitter.com/rboulton">Richard</a> on a story to step through the email alerts stack, working out the potential failure states at each point. Richard&rsquo;s now writing up some stories for monitoring or mitigating each of these. I finished the week picking up a story to add pagination to our new feed of latest changes to content in a sub-topic.</p>

<p>We ran <a href="https://twitter.com/1jh/status/530437720687267841">our first code club at GDS on Thursday evening</a>. I was really pleased with how it went: it felt like we had a good atmosphere where people were asking lots of questions. We&rsquo;re teaching HTML and CSS - mainly building on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">the Codecademy course</a> - and doing additional work to link this back into GOV.UK. Massive thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/roryoung">Rob</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/bazbremner">Barrie</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/alexmuller">Alex</a> for helping out.</p>

<p>And I went along to the &lsquo;Leadership Academy&rsquo; on Tuesday afternoon. It was the first of six sessions about leadership, being ran by the heads of the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/efficiency-and-reform-group">Efficiency and Reform Group</a>. I was pleased that there were other GDS people there (about half the people in the room were GDS folks).</p>
