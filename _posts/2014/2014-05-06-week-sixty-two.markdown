<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a bit of this week catching up. Whilst I was away, the &lsquo;specialist&rsquo; team has been reshuffled to make two separate teams, 'search and browse&rsquo; and 'product gaps&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m sticking around in the former.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;ve made a push to get the new &ldquo;unified&rdquo; search feature released this week. We&rsquo;ve not quite made it, as we&rsquo;ve decided to do a quick round of user research before we release it, but we&rsquo;re on course to ship it next sprint. As part of this, I added spelling suggestions into unified search, based on the functionality in the existing tabbed search.</p>

<p>Later this week, I spent some time working with the team managing the Rural Payments Agency&rsquo;s move to GOV.UK, to help resolve a few issues the agency is currently having with their content.</p>

<p>I also went along to Teacamp on Thursday night, where <a href="https://twitter.com/JanetHughes">Janet</a> was talking about <a href="https://identityassurance.blog.gov.uk/">the Identity Assurance project</a>. I also went along to <a href="https://twitter.com/undermanager">Russell</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mattsheret">Matt&rsquo;s</a> &ldquo;presenting club&rdquo; on Friday morning.</p>

<p>And, after more than a year, I also finished watching The West Wing this week.</p>
