<p>At the start of the week, I made some changes to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/competition">Competition topic</a> which had been requested by the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/competition-and-markets-authority">Competition and Markets Authority</a>. I also made a few changes so that <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transport">gov.uk/transport</a> is now also a topic, and not a redirect.</p>

<p>On our publishing tools this week, I&rsquo;ve changed <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/panopticon">Panopticon</a> so that we&rsquo;ll be able to make changes to tags through JSON requests - part of a broader piece of work to move the UI for tag creation out into <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/collections-publisher">Collections Publisher</a>. To help out the team working on User Needs, who want to &ldquo;validate&rdquo; the quality of a couple of thousand needs in the Need API, I built <a href="https://github.com/JordanHatch/need-validator">a thing</a> that&rsquo;s a bit reminiscent of the <a href="https://github.com/gds-attic/review-o-matic">review-o-matic</a>.</p>

<p>I organised our first meeting about the GDS Code Club this week. We decided what&rsquo;s in, what&rsquo;s out and what our next steps are. Since none of us have much free time at the moment, we&rsquo;re keen on picking a good existing HTML/CSS/JS course and running weekly sessions to help people through it.</p>

<p>And on Thursday, we were visited by the Ordnance Survey, who talked about some of the mapping services and APIs they provide - and we had an interesting chat about how their <a href="http://www.ordnancesurvey.co.uk/business-and-government/public-sector/mapping-agreements/psma-licensing.html">PSMA licensing scheme</a> applies when we build APIs using OS data.</p>
