<p>Quite amusingly, <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/unitedkingdom/comments/2bub8e/has_anyone_noticed_that_govuk_is_really_good/">last weekend&rsquo;s Reddit antics</a> got <a href="http://www.reddit.com/r/bestof/comments/2bysoq/redditor_posts_praise_for_a_government_website/">quite a bit of attention</a> on Monday night. I&rsquo;ve lost count of the amount of times I&rsquo;ve heard &ldquo;then make him Queen&rdquo; this week.</p>

<p>On Search and Browse this week, I released the new Panopticon functionality to add a workflow to tags. Based on last week&rsquo;s collab session, I wrote some stories about the new &ldquo;curated&rdquo; specialist sector browse pages. We had our retrospective and sprint planning on Tuesday, and I think this sprint is looking in decent shape.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve picked up a story to put our new &ldquo;Services and Information&rdquo; page live for the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/environment-agency">Environment Agency</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/maritime-and-coastguard-agency">Maritime and Coastguard Agency</a>, and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/government/organisations/uk-visas-and-immigration">UK Visas and Immigration</a>.  We didn&rsquo;t quite manage to get this live this week, but it should be out early next week. However, it&rsquo;s quite nice to get chance to work on the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall">Whitehall app</a>.</p>

<p>This week, I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href="https://twitter.com/ali_kelly_">Ali</a> to write a proposal for a new project to make improvements to our intranet. It&rsquo;s going to the Ops Board next week. I&rsquo;ll write a bit more about it soon.</p>

<p>I seem to have worked on quite a few hacks this week. I made <a href="https://github.com/JordanHatch/situation-room-monitor">a simple monitoring dashboard</a> for the tablets we&rsquo;ve installed outside our meeting rooms, backed by Redis. I&rsquo;ve upgraded <a href="https://github.com/JordanHatch/anthology">the app that runs our office library</a> to Rails 4, and started some preparatory work to migrate the authentication from GitHub to Google.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been iterating the <a href="https://github.com/JordanHatch/gds-missions">missions app</a> and, thanks to <a href="https://twitter.com/markhurrell">Mark&rsquo;s</a> help, <a href="https://twitter.com/1jh/status/494166982229774336">each mission is now printable as a poster</a>. I&rsquo;m hoping to share it with GDS folks next week.</p>

<p>And on Thursday afternoon, I went over to the Parliament to meet some of the digital team. I gave a demo of <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/maslow">Maslow</a>, our user needs tool, and answered some of their questions about GOV.UK. It was interesting to hear about the challenges they&rsquo;ve faced. (And I got to have <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/14607378519/">lunch on the terrace</a>.)</p>

<p>Whoa. It&rsquo;s been quite a busy week.</p>
