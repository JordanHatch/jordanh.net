<p>We had our sprint planning and retrospective on Tuesday. Our team focus is still on building email alerts for subtopics, and everything that&rsquo;s needed to support it.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent most of the week building out new functionality to manage tags in <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/collections-publisher">Collections Publisher</a>. Whenever a tag is created or updated, <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/panopticon">Panopticon</a> has to be kept up-to-date. Eventually, we&rsquo;ll also publish these tags into the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/content-store">content store</a>. It&rsquo;s a huge story, and it&rsquo;s going to take quite a while.</p>

<p>I also picked up a small change to put <a href="https://www.gov.uk/coal">gov.uk/coal</a> live as a topic page, similar to <a href="https://www.gov.uk/transport">gov.uk/transport</a> from last week. I love the idea of top-level topic pages, but I&rsquo;m a bit concerned that they&rsquo;re too focussed on specialist content, and not very useful to &lsquo;mainstream&rsquo; users.</p>

<p>The progress on the GDS code club moved one step further this week: after looking at a handful of different online courses to use for the club, we&rsquo;ve decided to go with <a href="http://www.codecademy.com/tracks/web">Codecademy&rsquo;s HTML/CSS course</a>. We&rsquo;ll use the session time to help people through the online lessons, or provide some extension activities if they&rsquo;ve already completed it.</p>

<p>I finished reading Hunter S. Thompson&rsquo;s <em><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fear_and_Loathing_on_the_Campaign_Trail_'72">Fear and Loathing on the Campaign Trail '72</a></em> this week. I&rsquo;ve been on-and-off with it all year, but glad I stuck it out. It&rsquo;s a brilliantly cynical account of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/United_States_presidential_election,_1972">the 1972 presidential election between Nixon and McGovern</a>. It&rsquo;s a must-read if you&rsquo;re interested in American politics.</p>

<p><a href="https://twitter.com/mattsheret">Matt</a> kindly gave me a copy of Laurie Penny&rsquo;s <em><a href="http://www.bloomsbury.com/uk/unspeakable-things-9781408824740/">Unspeakable Things</a></em>, which I&rsquo;ve started reading. (I&rsquo;ve got such a backlog of unstarted books that I simply have to start reading more regularly.)</p>
