<p>As suggested by the title, this week&rsquo;s notes mark a year&rsquo;s worth of week notes. <a href="http://probablyisjordan.tumblr.com/post/41454508955/week-one">When I started</a> I didn&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;d manage to write them consistently, but I&rsquo;ve surprised myself.</p>

<p>This week feels like a return to form. I made some things. I&rsquo;ve been working on a story to group content in specialist navigation pages by their format type, and it&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/12741089864/">pretty much complete</a> now. It involved quite a bit of work to the Content API, to add an alternative view for grouped results, and then just a handful of code changes to the existing navigation in Frontend.</p>

<p>Back at home, we&rsquo;ve had relatives come stay this week all the way from Portugal, so I&rsquo;ve spent some time with them. We went to visit Manchester&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.mosi.org.uk/">Museum of Science and Industry</a> on Thursday. It&rsquo;s a very good museum. It used to be the destination of choice for trips at school, and since then I&rsquo;ve visited a few times and gained a real appreciation for it and its exhibits.</p>

<p>On Friday, we had our monthly all-staff event. I particularly enjoyed talks from Richard Heaton (our permanent secretary) and Alex Evans from Media Molecule. In the afternoon, I talked with colleagues from the Fast Stream programme, who are planning an event for civil servants to learn to code, similar to <a href="https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2013/08/05/digital-learning-day/">the day we ran last year</a>.</p>

<p>And on Friday night, I went to see <a href="http://www.templestudioslondon.com/">The Drowned Man</a> at Temple Studios. It was incredible. I&rsquo;ve been drafting a short blog post about it which I might publish.</p>
