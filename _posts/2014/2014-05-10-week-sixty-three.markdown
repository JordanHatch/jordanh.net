<p>After the bank holiday weekend, we went straight into our retrospective and sprint planning on Tuesday. The main themes around this sprint are getting unified search live, and building a tool to manage &lsquo;best bets&rsquo; for particular search queries.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been picking up some of the final pieces of work needed before unified search can go live. I picked up a branch that <a href="https://twitter.com/rboulton">Richard</a> started, to weight search results by their popularity. Popularity weighting seems to work really well and should noticeably improve the quality of search results. I&rsquo;ve also added the &ldquo;report a problem&rdquo; form to the search results page to help us get feedback on particular searches.</p>

<p>Gemma from the <a href="https://mojdigital.blog.gov.uk/">Ministry of Justice&rsquo;s Digital Services team</a> came to visit GDS on Tuesday to find out about how we run show-and-tell. I answered some of her questions about how we communicate that it&rsquo;s happening, how we run it on-the-day and how we keep people to time. On Thursday, Manuel Mateo visited GDS from the European Commission so <a href="https://twitter.com/aliceenewton">Alice</a> and I spent a while talking with him about GOV.UK and GDS.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spruced up the <a href="http://blog.codeweek.eu">Code Week blog</a> this week, so that it uses the same design as the main website. Over the next couple of months, there&rsquo;ll start to be more activity around <a href="http://codeweek.eu">this year&rsquo;s Code Week</a>.</p>
