It's been on the cards for a while, but I've finally moved this blog from Tumblr over to GitHub Pages, on which I've been running [jordanh.net]({{ site.url }}/) for a while already.

The [jekyll-import](https://github.com/jekyll/jekyll-import) script made this really easy, and then I've thrown together a hacky JavaScript redirect for the existing Tumblr URLs (it's better than nothing!).

I have a short retrospective on 2015 in the works, which I'll publish in the next couple of days.
