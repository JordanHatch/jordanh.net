<p>First week notes of the year. Happy new year!</p>

<p>This month, GOV.UK is having a &lsquo;firebreak&rsquo;. I&rsquo;m not sure where the name came from, but it&rsquo;s a really great idea. Most of us have downed tools for a month and are spending the time fixing tech debt, testing parts of our infrastructure and prototyping some new ideas. This week, I&rsquo;ve been working with <a href="https://twitter.com/markhurrell">Mark</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/CharlotteClancy">Charlotte</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/vickybuser">Vicky</a> and Gaynor. We&rsquo;ve been exploring how we can better model services on GOV.UK.</p>

<p>At the moment, content on GOV.UK is collected together in buckets of vaguely related things, such as <a href="https://www.gov.uk/browse/births-deaths-marriages/child-adoption">this browse page about having children</a>. We currently don&rsquo;t connect up all the content for a single service (eg. child tax credits), nor do we provide a high-level view of all the services which you might need as you go through a particular phase in life (eg. childcare).</p>

<p>We want to make this better. We first looked at all the mainstream content on GOV.UK relating to childcare and organised it into the phase at which a user would need the content (from pregnancy to schools). I then tried experimenting with a few different models for an individual service, using content about child benefit and child maintenance. Mark made it a bit simpler and we arrived on <a href="https://twitter.com/1jh/status/553881371002032128">this model</a>.</p>

<p>This was actually my final week on the GOV.UK team. From next week, I&rsquo;m going to be working on the Transformation team at GDS, working with other departments building services. Due to sensitivity around the project I&rsquo;m working on, I think it&rsquo;s going to be difficult to carry on writing week notes, but I&rsquo;ll see how it goes.</p>

<p>It was sad to see a few people leave GDS this week. <a href="https://twitter.com/_ralph">Ralph</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/camille_">Camille</a> and Steve L are all moving on - they&rsquo;ll be missed. Wishing all of you the best for whatever you&rsquo;re doing next.</p>
