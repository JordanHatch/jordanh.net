Now [the myGov user audit][mygov] has wrapped up, I have joined the [Regulatory Reform Division][rrd] at the Australian Government Department of Finance.

I'm leading a new branch focussed on Regulatory Technology and Innovation and working with a great team.

I'm looking forward to working with regulators across government, including state and territories, and our growing RegTech industry in Australia. If this is you, [get in touch](mailto:jordan.hatch@finance.gov.au) and let's have a chat.
