A return to week notes after [more than five years]({{site.url}}/posts/week-notes-89/).[^1]

* This week was another of what's quickly become my standard routine: four days in Canberra for work and back to Sydney for the remainder. But not for much longer as we're moving soon. (And we bought a car!)

* I was pleased to see the announcement that the railways in Great Britain [will be folded under a new common brand](https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/great-british-railways-williams-shapps-plan-for-rail). It includes a network-wide rollout of _Rail Alphabet 2_, an updated version of Margaret Calvert and Jock Kinneir's original [Rail Alphabet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rail_Alphabet). Here's a video of [the new wayfinding design system](https://vimeo.com/459757685) by Spaceagency.

* In other UK government news, [GDS have a new strategy](https://gds.blog.gov.uk/2021/05/20/government-digital-service-our-strategy-for-2021-2024/). After a few years in the trenches it's nice to see GDS with a clearer focus and a stronger remit for delivery.

  The highlights for me are a rebooted GOV.UK Submit, a commitment to develop "whole services" around life journeys (which will be one to watch from here in Australia), and a growing hub in Manchester. Oh - and a section titled _"Where we won't be focusing"_ - not seen often enough in government strategy.

* After coming across it in [Frances' week notes](https://fberriman.com/2021/04/25/week-516/), I picked up a copy of _[Switch: How to Change Things When Change Is Hard](https://openlibrary.org/books/OL27658414M/Switch)_. It's a whistle-stop tour of organisational and societal change approaches that hit both the rational and emotional sides of our brain, and a very easy and accessible read.

* And a good week for RSS, as [Chrome for Android gets a new 'follow' feature](https://www.theverge.com/2021/5/20/22445284/google-rss-chrome-android-feature-test) based on RSS feeds. I still count myself part of [the RSS massive](https://gilest.org/stickers-rss-massive.html). (Here's [the feed for my blog posts]({{site.url}}/feed.xml) if you're interested.)
