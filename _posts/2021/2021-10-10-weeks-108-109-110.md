* We've [published an open invitation][research-panel] for agricultural businesses to join our new research panel. We've set up the panel to help us find businesses to research with as we design and deliver our new services. Up until now, the process of finding people to participate in our research has been rather ad hoc between teams. We hope the panel will make this process easier, so our researchers can spend less time finding users and more time doing research. Thanks to [Brigette][brigette], [Ruth][ruth] and our researchers for making this happen.

* We finished our team planning for Quarter 2, which runs from October to December. It's quite a formative quarter for us, with big milestones like the public beta release of our Readiness service, opening up performance dashboards to more meat processors, and shaping the first products in our Assurance service. By the end of the quarter, we'll be running services in production and at scale.

* Some good conversations with our friends in Information Services and Biosecurity about expanding our Export Account to other services in the department. In time, this could allow businesses who export and import to re-use their details between all of our services. Plus, by wiring up the foundations, it makes it easier for our export services to re-use capabilities developed in Biosecurity - like the new platform for booking inspections.

* For a bit of a teaser: this week, at short notice, we've assembled a crack team tasked with delivering a new service (in 7 days!) to help exporters meet the new requirements set by one of Australia's trading partners. More to come on this next week.

* GDS have published new guidance on [making services in an emergency][making-services-emergency] which, given the previous item, is timely for us.

* And from last week, it's great to see fellow New South Wales Government alumni [Chris Fechner][chris] appointed to lead the Digital Transformation Agency.

The lockdown ends in NSW tomorrow and it won't be long until we can finally move into our new house in Canberra. ðŸŽ‰
