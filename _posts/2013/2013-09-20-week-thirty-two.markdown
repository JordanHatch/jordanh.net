<p>This week is a tale of two teams.</p>

<p>I started the week with my final two days on the GOV.UK Mainstream team. I wrapped-up and handed over the work I&rsquo;ve been doing on campaign pages to Steve. I also took the opportunity to pick up a few small stories and fixes across our apps.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, I started my first day working on the new User Needs and Performance Reporting team. Given the amount of thinking about this that&rsquo;s happened so far, I decided to dive straight in and built a prototype of what the &ldquo;Maslow&rdquo; product could look like. If anything, it will give us a better sense of what we need out of the platform, and it&rsquo;s been a chance to experiment with a bunch of ideas I&rsquo;ve had, feeding in ideas from <a href="https://twitter.com/bmwelby">Ben</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/jystewart">James</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/lisa_e_scott">Lisa</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/psd">Paul</a> along the way. The result of three days of code has been something I&rsquo;m rather happy with. Next week, we&rsquo;ve planned a kick-off meeting for the project and I expect we&rsquo;ll be starting our first sprint too. Exciting stuff!</p>

<p>I picked up a copy of Grand Theft Auto V in the early hours of Tuesday morning. I made a last-minute call to attend <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/9778978566/">the midnight release</a> at my local games store in Chorley. Being <a href="http://probablyisjordan.tumblr.com/post/41454595364/on-long-commutes">in London most of the time</a>, I&rsquo;ve not had much chance to play, but the parts I have played have been very engaging and immersive. I&rsquo;m looking forward to playing more over the weekend.</p>
