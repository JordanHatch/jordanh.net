<p>I&rsquo;m going to combine the last two weeks together, as I&rsquo;ve been away on holiday.</p>

<p>I started last week with a fleeting visit to <a href="http://www.campus-party.eu/">Campus Party</a> at the O2 Arena in Greenwich. I was surprised at the enormous scale of the event: there were so many activities taking place. I also enjoyed a demo of <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/appmaker">Appmaker</a> from the folks at Mozilla, who were actually hacking on the project on the top floor of one of the concert venues.</p>

<p>I also attended <a href="http://2013.dconstruct.org/">dConstruct</a> last week. It was my first visit to Brighton. The majority of the talks were of a particularly high standard - particularly <a href="http://www.iamdanw.com/said/unexpected/">Dan Williams&rsquo; talk</a> on the unexpected uses of technology with a focus on surveillance. I also found Brighton to be quite a charming seaside town, despite the weather.</p>

<p>At the start of this week, I talked to Barclaycard around some of the specifics of the SmartPay migration for some of the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office&rsquo;s services on GOV.UK, and we now have enough information to begin work on some of the stories for this. I&rsquo;ve also been involved in data modelling discussions for the upcoming Needs Management &amp; Performance Reporting project - the first stage of which we&rsquo;ve dubbed &lsquo;Maslow&rsquo;. More on this to come soon.</p>

<p>And finally, I spent most of this week away on holiday. I visited <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phantasialand">Phantasialand</a> in Germany, followed by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Toverland">Toverland</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Efteling">Efteling</a> in The Netherlands. I might write a bit more about this in another piece.</p>
