<p>With the bank holiday weekend, it&rsquo;s been a short week.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I finished work on the ability to upload video captions to the asset manager from our <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/publisher">Publisher</a> app. This paved the way for work to start on the frontend to implement the video captions into video editions, and also has <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_content_models/pull/72">a neater way</a> than what was previously there for attaching assets to our data models.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, I started a sprint working on the 2nd Line Support team. I&rsquo;ve been keeping an eye on our automated monitoring alerts, and hacking on a few things alongside to improve our platform.</p>

<p>And finally, there&rsquo;s been a hive of press activity at GDS Towers this week. The World at One visited on Tuesday afternoon to see a bit more of what we&rsquo;ve been up to, and <a href="https://twitter.com/jemimakiss">Jemima</a> from The Guardian dropped by today. Keep your eyes peeled over the next few weeks.</p>
