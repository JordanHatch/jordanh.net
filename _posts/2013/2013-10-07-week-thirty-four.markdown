<p>At the start of the week, I continued working on User Needs with David and Stuart. I&rsquo;ve been building out the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_need_api">Need API</a> so that the Maslow client can create needs and fetch a list of all the organisations.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, I started a sprint on 2nd Line Support. It always seems to come around again quickly. So far this sprint, I&rsquo;ve set up a new monitoring service we are trying out, which performs availability checks from around the world. I&rsquo;ve also been doing some work with <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/signonotron2">Signonotron2</a> (our single-sign-on OAuth2 Provider) to make it authenticate using bearer tokens rather than HTTP basic auth when it syncs new user permissions to apps.</p>

<p>I spent a bit of time this week experimenting with the Google Calendar API and the calendars for our office meeting rooms. I built <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/10027948704/">a prototype in Ruby</a> at the start of the week, and then I moved on to building something a bit more elegant using Go. It&rsquo;s not quite ready yet, but stay tuned.</p>

<p>And finally, I enjoyed visiting the <a href="http://www.theodi.org/">Open Data Institute</a> on Friday. A cohort of GDS folk went along to a talk by <a href="https://twitter.com/tom_armitage">Tom Armitage</a> titled &ldquo;Spreadsheets &amp; Weathervanes&rdquo;. I liked the diagrams on the walls there: I spotted some familiar-looking  apps from our publishing platform.</p>
