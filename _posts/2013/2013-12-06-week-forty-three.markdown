<p>Eep, it&rsquo;s been busy this week.</p>

<p>On User Needs, we finished our assurance and we got the okay to go live, which is great news. We&rsquo;re starting to give access to some other people at GDS who are working on the transition. We&rsquo;ve added a label to the header to mark it as &lsquo;beta&rsquo;. I spent a bit of time with <a href="https://twitter.com/fofr">Paul</a> to plan a new round of user testing, and <a href="https://twitter.com/fatbusinessman">David</a> and I have wrapped up the duplicate needs spike, giving us some new stories to get the work done. I&rsquo;ve been doing some initial work to integrate Maslow needs with the Whitehall app. The first step has been to add the 40 'generic&rsquo; user needs for different formats on the Departments &amp; Policy section of GOV.UK.</p>

<p>The User Needs project is going to take a pause in a couple of sprints time. This is so that we can focus on some of the other pieces of GOV.UK work which is higher priority at the moment. <a href="https://twitter.com/bishboria">Stuart</a> is going to continue manning the fort whilst David and I work on other things.</p>

<p>I went to <a href="http://redmonk.com/thingmonk/">ThingMonk</a> on Monday afternoon and Tuesday. It was a conference about the Internet of Things, hosted by <a href="https://twitter.com/monkchips">James Governor</a>. I really enjoyed the talks, in particular those by Patrick Bergel and Tom Taylor. I took notes for the talks from the first half of the day on Tuesday, so I will write them up properly when I get chance.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, I attended a day-long training session run by <a href="http://www.civilservice.gov.uk/networks/hr/civil-service-learning">Civil Service Learning</a> about recruitment and selection. I&rsquo;ve helped out with some informal interviews for potential contractors before, but until now I&rsquo;ve not been on panels for any competency-based interviews. I found the training fascinating, as there&rsquo;s so much you need to consider throughout the whole process. The day finished with some mock improv interviews between us all, which were rather funny.</p>

<p>And finally, this afternoon, with the help of <a href="https://twitter.com/bandyroos">Ben</a>, Khadejah and many kind folk at GDS who donated some money, I <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/11239553715/">put up a Christmas tree by our purple sofas</a>. It feels quite festive now!</p>
