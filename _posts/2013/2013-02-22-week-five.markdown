<p>At GDS this week, I continued for the first half of the week on the 2nd Line Support team, where we migrated three of our currently-private repositories over to GitHub Enterprise. Since Wednesday, I&rsquo;ve been back on Mainstream, and have been working on adding the ability to upload images and pdfs to the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager">asset manager</a> from inside the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/travel-advice-publisher">travel advice publisher</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve also been learning a bit of <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> this week, with which I&rsquo;ve been experimenting building a <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_content_api">content api</a>-like app. <a href="https://github.com/JordanHatch/anthology">Anthology</a> has had a few bugs fixed and a Rails update too.</p>
