<p>This week has been manic.</p>

<p>On Monday, we had a post-mortem about the broken link to the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/honours/honours-lists">Queen&rsquo;s Birthday Honours lists</a>. Even though <a href="https://twitter.com/tomskitomski/status/345922939604054016">the issue was fixed on the same day</a>, we want to avoid this happening again. Some good ideas were suggested to make our 404 alerts work better and building a link checking feature into our publishing systems. I&rsquo;ve been experimenting this week to build something for the latter idea.</p>

<p>For most of the week, I visited Dublin for the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/digital-agenda-assembly-2013">Digital Agenda Assembly</a> hosted by the European Commission. It was also the second meeting of the <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/young-advisors">Young Advisors Expert Group</a>, and we had breakfast on Thursday morning with Neelie Kroes. It was also good to spend time with some of the digital champions from around Europe. Alja has <a href="http://blog.ialja.com/2013/06/22/entering-the-digital-playing-field-as-one-european-team-da13/">written some good thoughts</a> about the event on her blog.</p>

<p>Back in London at the end of the week, I&rsquo;ve been continuing to work on adding simple smart answers into <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/publisher">Publisher</a>. I finished separating out Nodes and Options into embedded collections in MongoDB and smart answers can now be persisted using the UI in Publisher. There&rsquo;s some more work I need to do to add the node select box, and some general tidying up.</p>

<p>And Friday was <a href="https://twitter.com/jack_franklin">Jack&rsquo;s</a> final day at GDS before he leaves for his final year at university. He will be missed, and I wish him all the best.</p>
