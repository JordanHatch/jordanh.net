<p>I started this week heading to Brussels for the first meeting of the Young Advisors Expert Group at the European Commission. There, I met the other young advisors and we also attended the launch of the Grand Coalition for Digital Jobs. I wrote a bit about the event, and a few thoughts on where part of the solution lies, on the <a href="http://digital.cabinetoffice.gov.uk/2013/03/07/young-expert-and-advising/">Government Digital Service blog</a>.</p>

<p>I arrived back in London on Tuesday evening, and I&rsquo;ve spent the rest of this week building a new app, which we&rsquo;re calling <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/transaction-wrappers">transaction-wrappers</a>. It is going to contain the FCO transactions which wrap around Barclaycard&rsquo;s EPDQ payment service, and I&rsquo;ve been working on a first-pass at four of the transactions: pay for a marriage certificate, deposit a marriage certificate, register a birth, and register a death. This app will also form the base for similar transactions around legalisation.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been doing a bit of spring-cleaning this week. I&rsquo;ve moved a lot of my stuff into Dropbox and I&rsquo;m trying to get into a better routine of taking notes, too. On <a href="http://twitter.com/rooreynolds">Roo&rsquo;s</a> recommendation, I&rsquo;m giving <a href="http://brettterpstra.com/projects/nvalt/">nvALT</a> a try.</p>
