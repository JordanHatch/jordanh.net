<p>I started this week where last week left off. I&rsquo;ve been taking my turn on the 2nd Line Support team, responding to alerts and running code deploys. I was also doing some work to make <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/frontend">Frontend</a> output logs in the JSON format so that it plays nicer with our <a href="http://kibana.org/">Kibana</a> instance. This was based on the work that <a href="https://twitter.com/intranation">Brad</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/philandstuff">Phil</a> did last week.</p>

<p>On Wednesday, I came back to the GOV.UK Mainstream Team, and I&rsquo;ve been helping get the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/calculators">Child Benefit Tax calculator</a> ready for its second round of user testing, which is taking place early next week. I&rsquo;ve been implementing some fixes to make the calculator more accessible, along with some new validation rules and a ton of copy changes.</p>

<p>Today, I&rsquo;ve also been helping <a href="https://twitter.com/HenryHadlow">Henry</a> in building a Chrome extension which will insert social media share links into GOV.UK content. It&rsquo;s a new approach we&rsquo;re trying out for user testing, which means we can experiment with ideas quicker without having to modify our app&rsquo;s code. I&rsquo;m looking forward to seeing both how the links perform, and how we could iterate this way of testing ideas in the future.</p>

<p>And finally, this week I hacked a bit on <a href="https://github.com/JordanHatch/departure-lounge">Departure Lounge</a>, a very airport-inspired representation of the upcoming events in a Google Calendar. It&rsquo;s been our release dashboard at GDS Towers for a while now, but I&rsquo;ve decoupled it somewhat from our use case and I&rsquo;ve documented the steps required to get it up and running.</p>

<p>Next week, I&rsquo;m particularly looking forward to seeing the outcome of the user testing, going to see <a href="https://twitter.com/BwaniJunction">Bwani Junction</a>, and our all-staff picnic.</p>
