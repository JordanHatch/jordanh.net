<p>Over the weekend, I spent some more time tidying up the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/need-o-tron">Need-o-tron</a>. I updated Rails and added Twitter Bootstrap to clean up the UI. There&rsquo;s still quite a lot of work that could be done to clean up the data and add our business needs.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of this week finalizing the code and copy for rolling out our user satisfaction survey across GOV.UK mainstream content. We&rsquo;re going to show an unobtrusive banner to 1 in 50 users who visit the site, to help us get a better idea of who uses our content and what they think could work better.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been experimenting a bit more with <a href="http://golang.org/">Go</a> this week. <a href="http://twitter.com/nickstenning">Nick</a> spent some time prototyping a <a href="https://github.com/nickstenning/router">router</a> and he gave me some help on getting some tests up and running for my implementation of the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_content_api">content api</a> in Go - something I&rsquo;ve been working on for a little while.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m now into the last few chapters of The Night is Large, which has been my reading material for the train over the last couple of months. It&rsquo;s really opening my eyes to a whole host of physics concepts along with some good background to notable writers, including a particularly good piece on <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Samuel_Taylor_Coleridge">Samuel Taylor Coleridge</a>.</p>

<p><a href="http://twitter.com/jack_franklin">Jack</a> and I have been playing <a href="http://openttd.org/">OpenTTD</a> a fair amount over the last few weeks, so in response to his new foray <a href="http://tilvim.com">TIL: Vim</a>, I&rsquo;ve registered <a href="http://tilttd.com">TILTTD.com</a> and will eventually get around to filling it with the lessons I learn from trying to build a functional railway.</p>
