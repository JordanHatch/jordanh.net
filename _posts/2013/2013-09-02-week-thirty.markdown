<p>With the bank holiday, this week&rsquo;s been rather short.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I built the new GOV.UK Help index page, based on <a href="https://twitter.com/amosie">Amy&rsquo;s</a> designs. Support pages are currently hard-coded in Frontend, but we&rsquo;re moving them out into a new Publisher-managed format to make it easier to update. We&rsquo;re renaming them to &ldquo;Help&rdquo; in the process.</p>

<p>On a similar theme, I&rsquo;ve started work this week on also moving <a href="https://www.gov.uk/workplacepensions">campaign pages</a> from Frontend into Publisher. This is quite an interesting challenge, particularly around how we display the organisation&rsquo;s logo from the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/whitehall">whitehall app</a>.</p>

<p>I enjoyed our office visit from Netflix&rsquo;s <a href="https://twitter.com/adrianco">Adrian Cockcroft</a> on Thursday. Adrian gave a brilliant lunchtime talk about how and why Netflix are &lsquo;cloud native&rsquo; and take an open source approach to their work.</p>

<p>And I also spent a little bit of time indexing the <a href="https://gds-attic.github.com/">GDS attic</a> of archived projects. It&rsquo;s worth a look - there&rsquo;s a lot more repositories earmarked to be moved there soon.</p>
