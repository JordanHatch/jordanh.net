<p>A very last-minute instalment of week notes this week.</p>

<p>On Monday, I finished the improvements to related links, and I wrote <a href="https://insidegovuk.blog.gov.uk/2013/07/31/refining-related-links/">a blog post about them</a> for the Inside GOV.UK blog, which got published on Wednesday after I deployed the changes.</p>

<p>With the Mainstream team, I went to Bletchley Park on Tuesday, the home of the British codebreakers during the war. It was fascinating - it&rsquo;s my second visit after the <a href="http://www.codemanship.co.uk/softwarecraftsmanship/">Software Craftsmanship event</a> last year - and it was also a <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/rooreynolds/9407923778/">great opportunity to get a team photo</a> (thanks Roo!). I&rsquo;ve uploaded <a href="https://secure.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/sets/72157634881557196/">my photos to Flickr</a>.</p>

<p>For the remainder of this week, I&rsquo;ve been doing a couple of spikes. The first spike was to look into <a href="http://www.barclaycard.com/smartpay/en/">Barclaycard&rsquo;s SmartPay platform</a>, investigating how we could migrate the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/fco-services">Foreign and Commonwealth Office&rsquo;s transactional services</a> app to use it. The second spike, around <a href="http://github.com/alphagov/fact-cave">the Fact API</a>, was to explore the different data types we&rsquo;d like to represent and make some suggestions. An already-compiled list of the most common facts and figures across GOV.UK was really helpful here.</p>

<p>Next week, I&rsquo;m timetabled in for the 2nd Line Support rota at GDS, and I&rsquo;m also going up to Birmingham to speak at this year&rsquo;s <a href="http://youngrewiredstate.org/">Young Rewired State</a>. I&rsquo;m quite excited :)</p>
