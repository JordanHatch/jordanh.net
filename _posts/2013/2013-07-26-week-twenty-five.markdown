<p>I started the week by carrying on with the story to separate related items on GOV.UK content into multiple groups, based on the section which the link is in. I ran into a few gotchas with <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice</a>, as we already send custom section titles and categories to <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/slimmer">Slimmer</a> for travel advice editions. It&rsquo;s all ready to go now, though, so it should head to production early next week.</p>

<p>On Wednesday and Thursday, I went along to a few sessions of MongoDB training along with some other members of the development team. Whilst I&rsquo;ve been using Mongo for a while now, I found it useful to learn a bit more about the internals, and the chance to experiment with) replica sets.</p>

<p>And today I&rsquo;ve been helping to run a &lsquo;digital learning day&rsquo; for members of the Technology in Business Fast Stream. Along with David, <a href="https://twitter.com/nickstenning">Nick</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/tombaromba">Tom</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/amosie">Amy</a>, we ran some hands-on sessions teaching a bit of code and design to those who are going to be leading up digital projects of the future in the civil service. For the session on server-side languages, I built an example web app to query the GOV.UK Search API using Node.js - <a href="https://github.com/JordanHatch/dld-govuk-search">the code is on GitHub</a>. It was also a bit of a learning day for us, as we&rsquo;d like to run these on a semi-regular basis in future, and we got some really good feedback in our 'retrospective&rsquo; session that will help us out.</p>
