<p>I&rsquo;ll start with a nod to last weekend, when I went along to <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/hacks/national-hack-the-government-2013">National Hack the Government Day 2013</a>. Working with <a href="http://twitter.com/harrym">Harry</a>, <a href="http://twitter.com/lily_dart">Lily</a> and <a href="http://twitter.com/edh649">Ed</a>, we built <a href="http://hacks.rewiredstate.org/events/nhtg-13/universirator">Universirator</a>, an app which takes <a href="http://unistats.direct.gov.uk/">Unistats</a> data and shows you the best (and worst) places to study based on the average graduate salary for the course you&rsquo;d like to take. We won the prize for <a href="http://twitter.com/marxculture">Mark O'Neil</a>&rsquo;s favourite hack.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of this week getting updates made to our <a href="https://www.gov.uk/overseas-passports">overseas passports smart answer</a>, and chasing up a few rate-change issues from last weekend.</p>

<p>Work to try and make smart answers easier to maintain - and some of the more complex calculators easier to use - has kicked off this week too. <a href="https://twitter.com/jack_franklin">Jack</a> and I spent a while sorting through a  each smart answer and grouping them into categories: those which fit into a simple &lsquo;choose your own adventure&rsquo; format; those which are complex calculators; and those which fit the void inbetween. Next week, we&rsquo;ll start hacking on some new tools to make these better.</p>

<p>Last night, I went along to Teacamp London in Victoria, where I heard some really interesting discussions on women in digital, and ways in which to address equality across the tech community. <a href="http://martinbelam.com/2013/digitalwomen-teacamp/">Martin Belam</a> has a good write-up of a handful of the talks.</p>
