<p>I arrived home from Orlando on Wednesday, after two weeks away. The remainder of this week has been spent getting back up to speed.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve started work this week on separating our internal related links into multiple groups. Instead of listing all related links together, they will be grouped into three categories: related items from the same sub-section (eg. Tax Credits), related items from across the parent section (eg. Benefits) and then those from other sections and elsewhere on GOV.UK. <a href="https://twitter.com/futurefabric">Guy</a> built some prototypes for user testing at the end of June, and they performed really well.</p>

<p>Next week, I&rsquo;ll be continuing work on related links, but we&rsquo;re also having some MongoDB training scheduled - similar to the ElasticSearch training a few months ago. On Friday, I&rsquo;m also helping run a &lsquo;digital learning day&rsquo; for members of the Civil Service Fast Stream, where we&rsquo;ll be giving an introduction to code and digital best practice to those who will be leading up digital projects around government in the future.</p>
