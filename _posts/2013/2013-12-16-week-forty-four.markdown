<p>I&rsquo;m kind of in-between projects now at GDS. User Needs is winding down a bit and we&rsquo;re starting to have conversations about the new project I&rsquo;m moving onto in the new year. I&rsquo;m told it includes improving search, browse and the homepage, building navigation for &lsquo;specialist&rsquo; users and then finding places for the 'specialist&rsquo; content to live. That&rsquo;s a ton of really interesting challenges.</p>

<p>Nevertheless, the User Needs fort is still quite busy. I&rsquo;m keen to make sure that we get the things we&rsquo;ve built out to our users before we leave the team, so this week we&rsquo;ve rolled out <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/maslow">Maslow</a> to the content designers from the Mainstream team, and a couple of people from the Transition team too. They&rsquo;ve been creating new needs and assigning them to content, which means that we&rsquo;ve now replaced old needs with Maslow needs in some of our most active pieces of content.</p>

<p>I finished adding the 'generic&rsquo; needs for Inside Government into Maslow. I added a notice to those needs to show that they are common across government. I&rsquo;ve also built a feature to mark a need as out of scope for GOV.UK. Until now, we&rsquo;ve kept well away from giving a need any kind of state, but this is the first step to making decisions on whether we meet a need. I like to think of it as being able to put the need into a 'no&rsquo; pile, whilst saving judgement on the 'yes&rsquo; and 'maybes&rsquo;.</p>

<p>Away from User Needs, I hacked a little bit on our <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/plek">Plek</a> gem to try and make it easier to run bits of our platform on their own. Until now, every service had to exist at unique and specific hostnames, based on a naming pattern. That&rsquo;s not always straightforward to set up, especially in the dev environment, so I&rsquo;ve added the ability to override the location returned for a particular service using environment variables. I&rsquo;ll try and document this, and what it means for people trying to use our code, in a bit more detail soon.</p>

<p>I had a chat with some of the <a href="http://ec.europa.eu/digital-agenda/en/young-advisors">Young Advisors Group</a> this week about <a href="http://codeweek.eu">Code Week</a>. On the back of the success of the first event, we talked how the event could grow next year. I like the idea of a broader movement to help join up all the code clubs and events and help them to share their best practice and experience.</p>

<p>And it wouldn&rsquo;t be right if Thursday&rsquo;s GDS Christmas Party didn&rsquo;t get a mention. It was a good night: I really like it when everyone gets together in the same room. On the way back, <a href="https://twitter.com/dafyddbach">Dai</a>, Lindsey and I did a good deed and <a href="https://twitter.com/dafyddbach/status/411325208793194496">looked after a girl who was very ill</a> on Oxford Street until an ambulance arrived.</p>
