<p>The <a href="https://www.gov.uk/support">support pages</a> gained some new content this week. I added a new answer to list <a href="https://www.gov.uk/support/about-govuk?_#govuk-data-sets">the sets of data which we use</a> on GOV.UK. We&rsquo;ll add to it when we increase the amount of data sets we use in the future.</p>

<p>On Thursday, we had a retrospective with the digital team from the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/fco">Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office</a>, looking at the months since December (when we started work to &lsquo;transition&rsquo; the FCO&rsquo;s website). Since then, we&rsquo;ve built <a href="https://www.gov.uk/foreign-travel-advice">travel advice</a>, <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-legalisation-post">legalisation</a> and <a href="https://www.gov.uk/deposit-foreign-marriage">other</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-foreign-marriage-certificates">consular</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-register-death-abroad">payment</a> <a href="https://www.gov.uk/pay-register-birth-abroad">transactions</a>. There&rsquo;s some really good feedback and we&rsquo;re going to go into a bit more depth in subsequent sessions.</p>

<p>I looked into how we use ElasticSearch for GOV.UK search on Friday. <a href="https://twitter.com/mnowster">Mazz</a> and I built up a list of six or seven things we&rsquo;d like to look into a bit more, which we&rsquo;ll be doing next week. It includes things like setting a relevancy threshold for results and reviewing the 'stop&rsquo; words we filter out of search queries.</p>

<p>And I finished reading The Night Is Large this week, a collection of essays by the late <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Gardner">Martin Gardner</a>. I&rsquo;ll write a short review soon :-)</p>
