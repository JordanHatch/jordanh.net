<p>My week at GDS this week has been split between the new search team and the mainstream team.</p>

<p>On the search team this week, I worked with <a href="https://twitter.com/markhurrell">Mark</a> to build a prototype of what search could look like if we displayed the top result from all three indexes above the tabs, which could help users looking for a government department or a specific title. We also prototyped how search could work if we consolidated the <a href="https://www.gov.uk/search?q=tax">current three tabs</a> down to just two. We had some good feedback from the work and there&rsquo;s been some stories added to the backlog to build those ideas out properly next week.</p>

<p>On mainstream, I made another revision to the bank holidays bunting - this time we&rsquo;re dropping it below the breadcrumbs and setting it back behind the content area, so it should be a bit more subtle. Check it out on Monday! I&rsquo;ve also been working on the ability to upload caption files for  <a href="https://www.gov.uk/write-business-plan">video editions</a>. We&rsquo;re going to use the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/asset-manager">asset manager</a> to host these files, so I&rsquo;ve been extracting out some of the code I wrote to handle assets in <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/travel-advice-publisher">travel advice publisher</a> into our <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_content_models">govuk_content_models</a> gem.</p>

<p>And this week, the Inside Government team reached the <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/8696413992/in/photostream">milestone</a> of moving 24 departments onto the site. We had a fitting <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/8696353480/in/photostream">celebration</a> after work on Tuesday.</p>
