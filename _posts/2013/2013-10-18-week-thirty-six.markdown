<p>This week, I&rsquo;ve been continuing work on the User Needs project. We&rsquo;ve done some planning to simplify what our minimum viable product looks like, and we&rsquo;ve been cracking on with getting it built. I&rsquo;ve worked on a user story to list all needs in <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/maslow">Maslow</a> from the <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/govuk_need_api">Need API</a> and I&rsquo;ve been working on changing the format of a Need ID. I&rsquo;ve also given Maslow a bit of aesthetic love and tidied up the form to make it easier to create a new need.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, I visited a school in Liverpool called <a href="http://thestudio-liverpool.co.uk/">The Studio School</a>, which teaches a curriculum tailored to programming and games development. I gave a talk about what we do at GDS, what a developer does, and about the way that we work. I also had chance to meet the students and see what they&rsquo;ve been working on. I really enjoyed my visit.</p>

<p>This week marked an important milestone: the first birthday of <a href="https://www.gov.uk/">GOV.UK</a>. I can&rsquo;t believe it&rsquo;s been an entire year already since we turned off Directgov and Business Link. In typical GDS style, we celebrated it with <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/10329522943/">cake, badges</a>, and <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/10330298496/">a giant birthday card</a>.</p>

<p>And I&rsquo;ve <a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/jordanh14/10348149526/">built a dashboard this week</a> for the office. It consumes the <a href="https://github.com/jordanhatch/situation-room">meeting room API</a> which I built last week. The <a href="https://github.com/jordanhatch/situation-room-dashboard">code for the dashboard</a> is now on GitHub.</p>
