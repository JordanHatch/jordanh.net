<p>This week, I&rsquo;ve been mainly wrapping up the initial build of the consular payment transactions from the Foreign &amp; Commonwealth Office. There&rsquo;s been quite a bit of discussion around how the user journeys should be implemented and whether the individual &ldquo;pay&rdquo; transactions would be too ambiguous for the user&rsquo;s need if they were to appear in search (many of these have associated smart answers or other guidance). Right now, we&rsquo;re going to keep them in search, but keep a close eye on data of how people use them, and take another look if necessary.</p>

<p>I also spent a while making our plans for the Legalisation transactions simpler. I started a first pass on how the transaction-wrappers app could incorporate these and next week there&rsquo;ll be a lot more work going on to build them out.</p>

<p>And, on Thursday, we had our second all staff event of the year at the Royal College of Surgeons, which was a great opportunity to show a few of the things we&rsquo;ve been working on to wider GDS, and to find out a bit more about what everyone else is doing.</p>
