<p>It&rsquo;s been another short week with Easter Monday being a <a href="https://gov.uk/bank-holidays">bank holiday</a>.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve spent a lot of the week working on changes to various <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers">smart answers</a> for upcoming rate changes as described in the budget, along with some fixes and updates for some of the FCO smart answers which launched last week.</p>

<p>To explore how we could make parts of our stack easier to get up and running with outside GDS, I wrote some <a href="https://github.com/alphagov/smart-answers-stack">experimental scripts</a> over the Easter weekend for the smart answers app. It uses the Apache server built into OS X to reverse-proxy the Ruby apps, with a few workarounds and app config to get things playing nice with each other.</p>

<p>In my spare time, I&rsquo;ve also been hacking on <a href="http://github.com/alphagov/need-o-tron">Need-o-tron</a> to tidy things up a little bit. We know there&rsquo;s things we&rsquo;d really like to change to make Need-o-tron useful again, and I feel like if we can tidy it up a bit, we&rsquo;d be better placed to decide on its future.</p>

<p>Over the weekend, I&rsquo;ll be heading to <a href="http://rewiredstate.org/hacks/national-hack-the-government-2013">National Hack the Government Day 2013</a> - which will be my first hack day for almost a year. Given how many hack days I used to attend (before I started working), I feel like I should try and make an effort to do more.</p>
