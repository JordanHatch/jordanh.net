<p>Lately, my <a href="http://probablyisjordan.tumblr.com/tagged/week-notes">week notes</a> have been brought up in conversation a increasing number of times. I felt it was about time I wrote a bit about them.</p>

<p>I <a href="http://probablyisjordan.tumblr.com/post/41454508955/week-one">started writing week notes</a> back in January. I started for a few reasons. For one, I wanted to motivate myself a bit more and keep a closer eye on the things I was doing and blogging felt a good medium to express that. I missed the team week notes we used to write on the <a href="http://govuk-dev.tumblr.com/">govuk-dev blog</a>, which became less and less frequent as we grew in size and diverged into multiple teams. I also admired some other folk who took time to regularly write week notes: <a href="http://matthewsheret.com/category/haar/week-notes/">Matt Sheret</a> and <a href="http://gofreerange.com/blog">Go Free Range</a> are doing this really well.</p>

<p>At first, I wasn&rsquo;t sure whether I&rsquo;d have the self-discipline to keep posting regularly. Indeed, there have been times when it&rsquo;s slipped a little and I&rsquo;ve frantically thrown some words together the following Monday morning. However on the whole, it&rsquo;s been easier to maintain than I thought. In fact, I haven&rsquo;t yet missed a week (holidays not included). Whilst I never expected my week notes to have much of an audience, it turns out people I never would have expected read them on a regular basis.</p>

<p>As the year has progressed, I&rsquo;ve noticed a slight shift in my week notes. Compared to the start of the year, I rarely write code for things outside of work anymore. I no longer read as much as I used to do either. Perhaps this will pick up again towards the winter.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m happy to see other people at GDS writing week notes too. <a href="http://jystewart.net/2013/06/22/week-1/">James</a>, <a href="http://daibach.co.uk/category/work/week-notes/">Dai</a> and <a href="http://tom.loosemore.com/2013/05/10/monthnote-1/">Tom</a> have dabbled with week (or month) notes. They&rsquo;re all worthwhile reading.</p>
