I took a lot of photos in 2017. I was fortunate to do quite a lot of travel this year, and I was pretty good at remembering to bring my camera kit along too.

I kept the camera in manual mode for most of the year, and my photos have definitely gotten better as the year has gone on.

Here's a few of my favourites.
