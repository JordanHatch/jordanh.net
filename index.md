I'm helping government continue to adapt to the changes brought about by technology and the internet.

I was part of the team that built the first version of [GOV.UK][gov.uk] at the [Government Digital Service][gds]. In 2015 I came to Australia to help set up the Digital Transformation Office.

Since then, I've worked as a ministerial advisor to the [New South Wales Government][nsw] and led teams transforming international trade for [Austrade][austrade] and the [Department of Agriculture][agriculture]. I'm currently working on the [myGov User Audit][mygov].

I aim to prioritise designing for user needs, starting small, and working in the open.

At the moment, I'm interested in the intersection of digital and regulatory reform, new approaches to funding digital teams, and growing Australia's government digital ecosystem.

I'm a British-Australian currently living in Canberra. Say hello at <jordan@jordanh.net>.
