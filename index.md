I'm helping government continue to adapt to the changes brought about by technology and the internet.

I was part of the team that built the first version of [GOV.UK][gov.uk] at the [Government Digital Service][gds]. In 2015 I came to Australia to help set up the Digital Transformation Office. I've worked as a ministerial advisor to the [New South Wales Government][nsw] and led teams transforming international trade for [Austrade][austrade] and the [Department of Agriculture][agriculture].

I'm currently working [on regulatory reform][rrd] in the Australian Government.
